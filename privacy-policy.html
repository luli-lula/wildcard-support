        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: February 27, 2026</p>

        <p>Wildcard ("we", "our", or "the app") is a plant identification and collection app. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This policy explains what information we collect and how we use it.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <p><strong>Photos.</strong> When you use the Discover feature, the app captures or selects a photo to identify a plant. The photo is sent to our server for AI-powered identification and is not stored on our server after processing. Your photos are saved locally on your device as part of your collection.</p>

        <p><strong>Location.</strong> With your permission, the app records the approximate location (city/area level) where you discover a plant. This is stored locally on your device as part of your field notes. Location data is not sent to any third party.</p>

        <p><strong>Device Information.</strong> When you send feedback via email, basic device information (iOS version, device model) is included to help us diagnose issues. No device identifiers are collected otherwise.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Plant identification:</strong> Photos are sent to our server, which uses iNaturalist's Computer Vision API and OpenAI to identify plant species. Photos are processed in real-time and not retained.</li>
            <li><strong>Card content generation:</strong> Species names are sent to our server to generate educational card content. No personal data is included in these requests.</li>
            <li><strong>AI chat:</strong> When you use the "Ask More" feature, your conversation messages are sent to our server for AI processing. Conversations are not stored on our server.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All your collection data — plant cards, photos, discovery locations, and badges — is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. We do not have a user account system and do not store your personal data on any server.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>iNaturalist</strong> (<a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/privacy">privacy policy</a>) — Used for plant species identification via their Computer Vision API, and for reference photos via their public API.</li>
            <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> (<a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy">privacy policy</a>) — Used for AI-powered plant identification fallback, card content generation, and chat responses.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloudflare</strong> (<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">privacy policy</a>) — Our server infrastructure provider.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use any analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Wildcard does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app is rated 4+ and is safe for all ages.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control. You can delete individual plant cards within the app, or delete all data by uninstalling the app.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>
